<p style="font-size:25px; font-family:comic sans ms"> How to play </p>
<p style="font-size:15px; font-family:comic sans ms">Click the green flag to start. (You may have to click twice) Click a mode to play. For Singleplayer, choose a character and a setting. 
  Each character has different characteristics, and you can view all of them <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MULMj1m6BlpKhfbWXtfq5fK9WareqXMu7CdKwxLgxKg/edit?pli=1#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>. When playing, you use wasd, where w is jump, a is left, d is right, and s is attack. 
Tokens appear randomly with a 5 second delay. Collecting them will give the player 5 HP. When the token turns yellow, collected gives you 10 HP. 
 You have to kill your opponent (HP to 0 or below) to win.    In Multiplayer mode, Player 1 chooses one of the players, and player 2 does the same. 
Then someone chooses a map/setting to play on. Player 1 uses wasd. Player 2 is the same but with the arrow keys. 
The player can only attack when the cooldown bar reaches zero. Falling in lava (red) deals 35 damage. Once one of the players reaches 0 or below 0 HP, the game ends with the other player winning.</p>
